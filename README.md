## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Plan Selection

Cooperation and collaboration between technical systems is a driving factor for research and technological advancement. Several problems pertaining to such systems, such as supply/demand in smart grids or smart city planning, are formulated as combinatorial optimization problems, in which each component of the system, referred to as agent, selects from an individual set of plans, with the goal to optimize a global objective. This is referred to as the plan selection problem. This project demonstrates a novel approach for the approximation of near-optimal solutions in such problems by utilizing recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

In this project we implement and evaluate variants of two state-of-the-art DRL architectures, the Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithm and the Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C) model. The results are compared against three baselines: the state-of-the-art I-EPOS framework, a genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization approach.
