# Datasets
Disclaimer: For licensing reasons we cannot distribute the PNW real world datasets used for the report experiments (signed NDA).
The config file is preset to use the gaussian synthetic dataset.

# Prerequisites
Before running any of the following commands make sure that:
1. The dataset folders are placed inside the data folder.
2. Change the "dataFolder", "maskDataAfterSort" and "experiment" options in code/config to correspond to the current experiment.
3. The initial working directory must be the dcpo.
4. The PYTHONPATH environment variable must be set to the dcpo/code directory.

# Running the models
1. DCPO: DQN
cd code/reinforced_epos
python dcpo_dqn.py --suffix gaussian_full
2. DCPO: A3C-DNN
cd code/reinforced_epos/helpers/oop
python a3c_main.py
